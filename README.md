Hello Welcome to the Saucisse Project.
This project is the creation of a Discord Bot to play music.

the github is missing a .env file with your discord token in.
first create a discord bot and get his token, crate a .env file and fill it like this: DISCORD_TOKEN = {place here your token}

then replace the str in the 'pre' variable at the begining of Saucisse.py and keep 2 chatacter and replace the path to ffmpeg in your computer.

then you can run Saucisse.py and your bot will be online.
