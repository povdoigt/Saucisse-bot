Hello Welcome to the Saucisse Project.
This project is the creation of a Discord Bot to play music.

the github is missing a .env file with your discord token in.
crate a .env file and fill it like this: DISCORD_TOKEN = ...

then replace the str in the 'pre' variable at the begining of Saucisse.py and keep 2 chatacter.

 then you can run Saucisse.py and your bot will be online.
